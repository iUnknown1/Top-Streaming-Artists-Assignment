Processing data for Spotify Top Streaming Artists

Data.csv is the csv file of the spotify data. The TopStreaming.java is the constructors and getters and setters for the data. ReadStreaming.java is the reading of the csv file of the spotify data. 

I seperate them into different files because it makes it easier for me to trace what im doing and where to go back to if i make a mistake.
